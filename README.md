# hello-world
My first step in learning everything I need to know.
I am 26 years old girl working full time in a call center. I sincerely want to learn everything I can and become an IT professional in the future. I will always try to do my best to achieve this dream. I look up to web-developers, programmers, web-designers, and people in this industry in general. I think they are really, really, cool!
